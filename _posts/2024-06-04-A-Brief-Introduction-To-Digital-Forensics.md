Before discussing digital forensics we need clarity about forensic sciences.

You might have listened to the word forensics in movies, which is basically used to retrieve data from the crime scene.
In simpler words, forensic science is a branch of science to collect evidence using various scientific techniques and analysis of the electronic hardware or software available from the crime scene.
In the case of digital forensics, usually electronic evidence is collected. Electronic evidence is a piece of data available from the electronic devices involved in the crime. And for extraction of this data, five steps are followed :
1. **Identification**: It is the very first step in which the devices under attack are identified. In this stage, it is determined how long the attacker had access to the system and creating a timeline of the attack. 
2. **Preservation**: The identified devices are seized and stored to avoid any cases of tampering. After that an investigator can use various forensic methods to extract the data from the device that may be helpful and then store this data securely.
3. **Analysis**:  The data preserved from the under-attack devices are replicated to perform the analysis that is recovering encrypted files or documents. This stage may involve a lot of techniques like reverse steganography, or various tools like Autopsy, Volatility etc.
4. **Documentation**: After the analysis is done, the findings are properly documented so that the whole investigation process is understandable. Thus it provides a conclusion to a criminal activity so that the same mistakes are not repeated.
5. **Presentation**: The findings can be presented to the criminal court to provide evidences.
