Currently, I am a Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College student pursuing Computer Science.
I am highly enthusiastic about mobile pen testing and the forensics domain of cybersecurity.
Recently, I started learning about the fields mentioned above and also am an active Competitive Programmer.
In the following blogs, I will be writing detailed explanations about whatever I have learned so far.
Do give them a read and let me know (through mail) if I can improve the articles any further. Your feedback is greatly appreciated.
